					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>
						My interests lie in the field of Intelligent Robotics, Autonomous Vehicle Technology, 
							Computer Vision, Controls, Computer Programming, and its applications in a broad range of circumstances.
						
						</br></br>During my freshman year at the 
						university, I got introduced to the field of robotics. I was amazed by robot's potential to help our society. 
						Intelligent robots have been revolutionizing fields ranging from Agriculture to Space Science but they are far 
						from being perfect. I am well aware of the current efforts going on to solve problems and to overcome technical 
						difficulties obstructing the development of highly intelligent machines. To be part of these efforts is what 
						motivates me to work in the field of Intelligent Robotics. 
						
						
						</br></br>I have also worked with some amazing companies as an intern. From Jan-May 2020, I completed my final-year project (Internship) from the Institute for Plasma Research 
						(IPR), Gandhinagar. I was working on the Design and Prototype Development of a Multi-DOF Parallel Haptic Arm. 
						In the summer of 2019, I got an opportunity to work at Sea Tech Lab, Florida Atlantic University, FL, USA as a 
						research scholar. I did research on optimal path planning of Unmanned Surface Vehicles in dynamic environments. 
						I was guided by Dr. Manhar Dhanak and Armando Sinnisterra. </br></br>I’m also interested in Mechanical Product 
						designing and Automation. In my sophomore year, I worked at Tirth Agro Technology Pvt. Ltd. as a Trainee. </br></br>
